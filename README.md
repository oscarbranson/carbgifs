# Animations of Carbon in Seawater

A rather silly procrastination project. Some enlighten, most confuse.

## For Example:

This one shows how the relationship between total Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC), Total Alkalinity (TA) and seawater pH, [CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>] and pCO<sub>2</sub> change as you warm seawater from 5 to 35 C:

This one shows how this plays out in the oceans. Changes in temperature, salinity and pressure as water moves from the deep NE Pacific to the surface drive big changes in carbon speciation. This is the mechanisms behind the [solubility pump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility_pump#:~:text=In%20oceanic%20biogeochemistry%2C%20the%20solubility,ocean's%20surface%20to%20its%20interior)!

## More?

So far I've done temperature, salinity and pressure.

Scripts are in the root of the repo, finished products are in `animations/`.
