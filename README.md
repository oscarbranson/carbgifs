# Animations of Carbon in Seawater

A rather silly procrastination project. Some enlighten, most confuse.

## For Example:

This one shows how the relationship between total Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC), Total Alkalinity (TA) and seawater pH, [CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>] and pCO<sub>2</sub> change as you warm seawater from 5 to 35 C:

## More?

So far I've done temperature, salinity and pressure.

Scripts are in the root of the repo, finished products are in `animations/`.
